title: Bad Design
subtitle: An example of bad design on the Williams College Peoplesoft Website.
---

For my bad design I have chosen to use the main menu for the Peoplesoft page for Williams students. I chose this page because it has caused me plenty of frustration in the past when I had to enroll for classes or look up my schedule. Students mostly use this webpage whenever they want to check their academic records, enroll in classes, drop or swap classes, and to buy bus tickets. This page is poorly designed because it leaves a lot of blank and empty space on the homepage and does not provide any emphasis on the actual buttons of menus of the site. Also, the expansion feature of the menus is incomaptible with the size of a mobile screen and prevents the student from clicking on any of the menu options. This website is definitely not easy to use at first and frustrates many students as they use it.

For each design's page, explain why you chose this design. Include pictures to tell the story. Think about who uses this design, when they are using it, and why they are using it.
Reflect on the design - what is it about this design that makes it good (or bad)? You might not necessarily be able to articulate this clearly at this point in the course… that’s okay! Try your best. Is it easy to use? Does it make people feel good?
