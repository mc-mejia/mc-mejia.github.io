# Bad Design

For my bad design I have chosen to use the main menu for the Peoplesoft page for Williams students. I chose this page because it has caused me plenty of frustration in the past when I had to enroll for classes or look up my schedule. Students mostly use this webpage whenever they want to check their academic records, enroll in classes, drop or swap classes, and to buy bus tickets. This page is poorly designed because it leaves a lot of blank and empty space on the homepage and does not provide any emphasis on the actual buttons of menus of the site. Also, the expansion feature of the menus is incomaptible with the size of a mobile screen and prevents the student from clicking on any of the menu options. This website is definitely not easy to use at first and frustrates many students as they use it.
