subtitle: An example of bad design on the Williams College Course Catalog website.

For my good design I chose the updated version of the Williams College Course Catalog. The original course catalog was not as user friendly for students who wanted to browse potential course options. This version provides a more visual map of the different course topics and whether or not they fit into a major or concentration. Also, the search feature, which is intuitively placed on the top right of the page, allows students to have two different methods to find classes.
